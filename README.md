Overview

  The task was to improve upon a funcitonal website to provide a more specific way in which the user will be able to access the data. Previously the UFO data could only be filtered by the date of a sighting. Upon reworking the script the user is now able to set various filters and search for UFO sightings based on multiple critera which now include the date, city, state, country, and shape.

In order to perform a search the user must first open the webpage, then choose as many filters as they would like in order to better understand the data. The user can choose between date, city, state, country, and shape in order to sort the UFO Sighting data. Push the Filter Table button in order to carry out the sort. In order to clear all filters click on the Clear Filters button.
